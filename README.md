# Font Code sample project

This project was made to demonstrate the OpenGL font code.

The code for this font system has been used multiple times in multiple commercial applications and is available freely via
the internet as it has been released for public use.

If there are any questions regarding the legal nature of the code, please feel free to consult with aahigh@gmail.com .. there
has never been a public release of this font code on its own but it has been released with larger packages.
